title: Innovating the esports team website experience.
client: OpTic Gaming
services: Planning, Design, Development
description: OpTic Gaming is one of the world's leading eSports organisations. Their site had so much potential so I built an un-commissioned prototype to improve on the aesthetics and user experience. After reaching out to the CEO of OpTic Gaming, we decided to pursue the prototype and give some much needed love to the organisation's website.

### The Challenge

Sickodds is a betting comparison platform that focusses on arguably the best sport of all. Esports.

Built on WordPress, we worked with Sickodds to create a scalable platform that would be able to regularly pull in the lastest esports odds from across a vast range of providers, then collate and present that data.

The website now features a fantastic range of esports betting odds, individual provider reviews and also an blog of industry news and predictions.
