### The Challenge

Esportsify provides esports themed websites to tens of thousands of teams all around the world and are the largest esports website provider around.

They provide a range of pre-made templates for teams to choose from, but their elite esports teams work with Esportsify directly to create their own unique, branded designs. We were excited to work with Esportsify to turn these bespoke website designs into templates that integrated directly into their platform.

In the process of this project we had the honour of working with TCM Gaming, Luminosity, Ninjas in Pyjamas and more.
